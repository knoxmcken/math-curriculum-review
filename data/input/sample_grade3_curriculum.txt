# Grade 3 Mathematics Curriculum - Sample

## Unit 1: Multiplication and Division

### Lesson 1: Understanding Multiplication

**Objective:** Students will understand multiplication as repeated addition and equal groups.

**Content:**
Multiplication is a way to add the same number multiple times. For example:
- 3 × 4 means "3 groups of 4"
- This is the same as 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

**Practice Problems:**
1. Draw 5 groups of 3 objects
2. Write the multiplication sentence: 5 × 3 = ___
3. Solve: 4 × 6 = ___

### Lesson 2: Division as Fair Sharing

**Objective:** Students will understand division as splitting into equal groups.

**Content:**
Division helps us share things fairly. If we have 12 cookies and want to share them equally among 4 friends:
- 12 ÷ 4 = 3
- Each friend gets 3 cookies

**Practice Problems:**
1. 15 ÷ 3 = ___
2. Share 20 pencils equally among 5 students. How many does each get?

## Unit 2: Fractions

### Lesson 3: Introduction to Fractions

**Objective:** Students will understand fractions as parts of a whole.

**Content:**
A fraction represents part of a whole. The fraction 1/4 means:
- One part out of four equal parts
- If you cut a pizza into 4 equal slices, each slice is 1/4 of the pizza

**Visual:**
[A circle divided into 4 equal parts, with 1 part shaded]

**Practice Problems:**
1. What fraction of the shape is shaded? [Image shows 2 out of 8 parts shaded]
2. Draw a rectangle and shade 3/6 of it
3. Which is larger: 1/2 or 1/4?

### Assessment

**Formative Assessment:**
- Exit ticket: Solve 7 × 8 and explain your thinking
- Draw and label a fraction model for 2/3

**Summative Assessment:**
- Unit test covering multiplication, division, and fractions
- Performance task: Create a fair sharing story problem
